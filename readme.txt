This application runs as a MATLAB App.
It is intended as more of an educational piece, to show the impact that image manipulation can have when pre-processing image velocimetry data. 
As an example, please download the two DEMO Images to view how it impacts tracer visibility on a river in Wales, UK. 
These images are exactly 1s apart and can are used in the processing of velocity with KLT-IV.

Simply open the app, select the image file you wish to process, and the app will walk you through the possible options and will produce graphics for comparison.
